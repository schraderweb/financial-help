How can you<em> not<\/em> be happy basking in the sunshine, relaxing on the beach, celebrating with a cookout, playing with your kids or lounging poolside? And while it all sounds heavenly, sometimes summer is spent figuring out how to entertain the kiddos from dawn to dusk so they don\u2019t drive you wacko.<\/p>\n<p>If you really want a happy, healthy summer\u2014one where you can bask in its long days without the kids driving you crazy\u2014try these nine tips. (We recommend reading this in your hammock.)<\/p>\n<h4>1.\u00a0Plan \u201cme\u201d time<\/h4>\n<p>When life gets crazy, (when is it not?) the first thing that usually goes to the wayside is time just for you. Take turns with your spouse and make dates with yourself. Watch the kiddos while your spouse gets a little solitude, and then let your spouse give you that precious time, too. Hang out in a coffee shop, read a good book, meditate, take a long bike ride or catch an afternoon matinee\u2014do something that allows you to think, reflect, relax or just unplug.<\/p>\n<h4>2.\u00a0Make healthy eating fun<\/h4>\n<p>Browse farmers markets and get some gorgeous seasonal produce. Teach your kids about the health benefits of real foods by experimenting with clean-eating recipes to make delicious, colorful meals and snacks.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>3.\u00a0Fill your calendar with joy<\/h4>\n<p>You can have a lot of control and influence over how happy your summer is if you proactively plan weekends with your absolute favorite things to do, like hosting a cookout for your street, planning a weekend getaway or scheduling an outdoor adventure. Not only do you get the joy that comes from anticipation, but you also get a fun experience and a wonderful memory! (It\u2019s a trio of happiness.)<\/p>\n<h4>4.\u00a0Investigate your favorite exercise<\/h4>\n<p>The key to exercising regularly isn\u2019t about finding the time\u2014it\u2019s about finding an exercise you love. Because if you love it, you will do it. Summer is the ideal time to try out some new activities. Paddle-boarding anyone? Golf? (Skip the cart.) Take your kids on a family hike. Sign up to jog your first 5K. Go in search of an exercise to fall in love with, and you just might get hooked.<\/p>\n<h4>5.\u00a0Remind yourself why sleep is wonderful<\/h4>\n<p>Make your bedroom a place of serenity and calm by cleaning out any clutter that could be clogging you mentally. Get your favorite sheets and comforter. Open a window if it\u2019s cool enough for gentle breezes. Fully embrace sleep as one of life\u2019s great pleasures.<\/p>\n<h4>6.\u00a0Know what recharges you<\/h4>\n<p>When you\u2019re feeling run down and frazzled, what restores you? What fills you up? Make a list of the top three activities that replenish your mind and body and then carve out time to do them. You\u2019ll love life more when you feel full and mentally clear, instead of frazzled and depleted.<\/p>\n<h4>7.\u00a0Seek a change of scenery<\/h4>\n<p>Go on a vacation, drive to your neighboring town or just try a new restaurant. Changing up your normal environment can be uplifting and offer a new perspective.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>8.\u00a0Keep a journal<\/h4>\n<p>Journaling helps with self-awareness, mental clarity and preserving memories, but keep the right journal for you. It could be a one-sentence journal about your day or maybe a travel journal where you record your summer adventures. You may even consider keeping a gratitude journal, where you jot down what you appreciate about your day. If it\u2019s more your speed, use your journal to doodle or brainstorm your next big idea.<\/p>\n<h4>9.\u00a0Go deeper with conversation<\/h4>\n<p>If you\u2019re having a dinner party, as you set the table, think about how you\u2019d like to direct the conversation with your guests. Sometimes, with a little planning, you can cultivate meaningful conversations instead of surface chitchat. Bonus tip: Don\u2019t start cleaning up when people are done eating, as that signals everyone that dinner is over. Sit and just enjoy your conversations\u2014it\u2019s good for your health and longevity!<\/p>\n<p>Make this your best summer yet by aligning it closer to what you value most. Happiness will follow.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Avoid the sunburn and bug bites this year and enjoy a summer filled with fun and family.
