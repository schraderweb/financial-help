Older credit problems count for less, so poor credit performance won&#8217;t haunt you forever. The impact of past credit problems on your FICO Scores fades as time passes and as recent good payment patterns show up on your credit report. And good FICO Scores weigh any credit problems against the positive information that says you&#8217;re managing your credit well.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Be aware that paying off a collection account will not remove it from your credit report.<\/strong><br \/>\nIt will stay on your report for seven years.<\/li>\n<li><strong>If you are having trouble making ends meet, contact your creditors or see a legitimate credit counselor.<\/strong><br \/>\nThis won&#8217;t rebuild your credit score immediately, but if you can begin to manage your credit and pay on time, your score should increase over time. And seeking assistance from a credit counseling service will not hurt your FICO Scores.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Amounts Owed Tips<\/h4>\n<p>This category contributes 30% to a FICO Score&#8217;s calculation and can be easier to clean up than payment history, but that requires financial discipline and understanding the tips below.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keep balances low on credit cards and other &#8220;revolving credit&#8221;.<\/strong><br \/>\nHigh outstanding debt can affect a credit score.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pay off debt rather than moving it around.<\/strong><br \/>\nThe most effective way to improve your credit scores in this area is by paying down your revolving (credit cards) debt. In fact, owing the same amount but having fewer open accounts may lower your scores.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t close unused credit cards as a short-term strategy to raise your scores.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t open a number of new credit cards that you don&#8217;t need, just to increase your available credit.<\/strong><br \/>\nThis approach could backfire and actually lower your credit scores.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Length of Credit History Tips<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>If you have been managing credit for a short time, don&#8217;t open a lot of new accounts too rapidly.<\/strong><br \/>\nNew accounts will lower your average account age, which will have a larger effect on your scores if you don&#8217;t have a lot of other credit information. Also, rapid account buildup can look risky if you are a new credit user.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>New Credit Tips<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do your rate shopping for a given loan within a focused period of time.<\/strong><br \/>\nFICO Scores distinguish between a search for a single loan and a search for many new credit lines, in part by the length of time over which inquiries occur.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Re-establish your credit history if you have had problems.<\/strong><br \/>\nOpening new accounts responsibly and paying them off on time will raise your credit score in the long term.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Note that it&#8217;s OK to request and check your own credit report.<\/strong><br \/>\nThis won&#8217;t affect a score, as long as you order your credit report directly from the credit reporting agency or through an organization authorized to provide credit reports to consumers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Types of Credit Use Tips<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Apply for and open new credit accounts only as needed.<\/strong><br \/>\nDon&#8217;t open accounts just to have a better credit mix \u2013 it probably won&#8217;t raise your credit score.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Have credit cards \u2013 but manage them responsibly.<\/strong><br \/>\nIn general, having credit cards and installment loans (and paying timely payments) will rebuild your credit scores. Someone with no credit cards, for example, tends to be higher risk than someone who has managed credit cards responsibly.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Note that closing an account doesn&#8217;t make it go away.<\/strong><br \/>\nA closed account will still show up on your credit report, and may be considered by a score.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To summarize, &#8220;fixing&#8221; a credit score is more about fixing errors in your credit history (if they exist) and then following the guidelines above to maintain consistent, good credit history. Raising your scores after a poor mark on your report or building credit for the first time will take patience and discipline.<\/p>\n<div id=\"feedback\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Financial Tips &#8211; How to Fix a Credit Score &amp; Maintain Good Credit Payment History Tips Contributing 35% to a<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":373,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[25],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/financialhelp.pro\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/394"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/financialhelp.pro\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/financialhelp.pro\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/financialhelp.pro\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/financialhelp.pro\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=394"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/financialhelp.pro\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/394\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":431,"href":"https:\/\/financialhelp.pro\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/394\/revisions\/431"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/financialhelp.pro\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/373"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/financialhelp.pro\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=394"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/financialhelp.pro\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=394"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/financialhelp.pro\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=394"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
